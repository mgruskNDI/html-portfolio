<h1>The Best Series! - By Myan</h1>

<h2>My Top 5 Series of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Sopranos</h3>
<p>A show that keeps revealing itself, the more times you've seen it. Characters
    are endlessly deep, the conflicts are believable and memorable, and the writing
    is humorous but poignant.
</p>

<h3>GIRLS</h3>
<p>The ultimate show for Milennial women. So relatable.</p>

<h3>Succession</h3>
<p>Fuck off.</p>

<h3>Mad Men</h3>
<p>"That's what the money's for!"</p>

<h3>The White Lotus</h3>
<p>Each season is so good.</p>
